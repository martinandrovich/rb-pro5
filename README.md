# rb-pro5

The project combines the fields of robotic path planning, computer vision and artificial intelligence, to be implemented as algorithms with the purpose of controlling a robot within a simulated environment; this environment contains marbles where the objective is to map the environment and collect marbles efficiently.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project is compiled using CMake and built with:

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - used for computer vision
* [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) - used for simulation environment
* [FuzzyLite](https://fuzzylite.com/) - used for fuzzy control

### Installing

The dependencies can be installed on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libopenv-dev
sudo apt-get install gazebo
```

### Demo

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
