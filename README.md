# rb-pro5

The project combines the fields of robotic path planning, computer vision and artificial intelligence, to be implemented as algorithms with the purpose of controlling a robot within a simulated environment; this environment contains marbles where the objective is to map the environment and collect marbles efficiently.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dependencies

This project is compiled using CMake and built with:

* [OpenCV 3.2](https://opencv.org/) - used for computer vision
* [Gazebo 9](http://gazebosim.org/) - used for simulation environment
* [FuzzyLite](https://fuzzylite.com/) - used for fuzzy control

### Installing

The dependencies can be installed on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
sudo apt-get install libopencv-contrib-dev
curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh
```

**Notice**, if using Visual Studio Code C/C++ extension, the linter might have issues with the Gazebo header files; simply add the following lines to the include path to resolve this issuse:

```
/usr/include/gazebo-9
/usr/include/sdformat-6.2
/usr/include/ignition/math4
/usr/include/ignition/msgs1
```

### Demo

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
