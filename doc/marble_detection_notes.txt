//Read from a video file, and use the image sequence to determine the correct morphology methods in order to locate and detect marbles.


//Step 1: Done - 14:33

/*
    Get a video of the robot moving around a marble so there is different light settings. This is to make the model of the marbles more robust.


    We now have a method called test_run, in which the user manually controls the robot, whilst a video is made from the recorded images from the camera of the robot.
    There were some problems regarding writing the video file.. some times it core dumps due to wrong cv::Size match when the videowriter tries to write to the file.
*/

//Step 2:

/*
    Use the recorded video, in order to tune the morphology settings.
    Perhaps filter the video from gauss noise.
*/

//Step 3:

/*
    Check if the obtained marble model works as intended;    
    If not, try to use Hough-circle detection.
